A research on creating fast two-stage fingerprint matching system prototype.

In order to solve the problem of scalability and recognition quality we are proposing two-stage matching scheme using continuous classification, where the fingerprints database is first filtered by a texture-based matching (modification of a FingerCode algorithm) and the filtered results are finely matched using minutiae-based approach.

As the computations are, filtering and matching algorithms are implemented using NVIDIA CUDA technology to dramatically decrease the matching time.
